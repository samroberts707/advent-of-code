# Advent of Code
This is a repo for my Advent of Code puzzles, my intention is to store my solutions annually for the foreseeable future here. I'll be organising my solutions by year and challenge.

The challenges can be completed in any programming language I choose. I will probably be using JavaScript (ES6) and Python because of my familiarity with them. 

There will be 2 challenges released everyday, but you can only get access to the second challenge of the day once completing the first. Each challenge is worth one star, my target is to get at least 25 stars.
